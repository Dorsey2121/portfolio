        <p>My business objective was to create a user-friendly website that would help my client grow her customer base. My plan was to create a sleek web design that followed her brand-guidlines as well as create a new icon logo for the business. Furthermore the website had to be easy to navigate for an older audience as well as support an online store.</p>

        <h2 class="zetta push-0">CMS Implementation</h2>
        <p>To allow customizability of the website for the client, I implemeted <i>Wordpress</i>, a content management systems that builds the website. <i>Wordpress</i> allows me as the developer to choose what areas the client will be able to change and update. This allows me to ensure the client can keep their content up to date, without having to worry about breaking their website.</p>
