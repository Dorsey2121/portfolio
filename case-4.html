        <h2 class="zetta push-0">Objective</h2>
        <p>My business objective was to create a user-friendly website that would help my client grow her customer base. My plan was to create a sleek web design that followed her brand-guidlines as well as create a new icon logo for the business. Furthermore the website had to be easy to navigate for an older audience as well as support an online store.</p>

        <h2 class="zetta push-0">Logo Design</h2>
        <p class="push-0">The new Hair by Janice logo was designed to cater to Janiceâ€™s target customer base. Our client wanted a brand that conveyed the message that everyone is welcome. Our client is big in the LGBQT community and we wanted to embrace that. The upside down triangle is generally viewed as a sign of equality and pride. The colour and simplicity of the logo was to give a gender neutral feel as well as being warm and inviting. The logo was designed to give a neon sign feel that is trendy in the hairdressing industry.</p>

        <h2 class="zetta push-0">Design Process</h2>
        <p>The design process began with market research which enabled us to create questions for our first one-on-one meeting with our client. From there, sketches of the website wireframes and logo were devised. The wireframe sketches were created in <i>Adobe XD</i>, a prototyping software for web and mobile apps. Two more client meetings were conducted to refine the final website design. The website was created in a text editor called <i>Atom</i>.</p>

        <h2 class="zetta push-0">Final Web Design</h2>
        <p>The most important factor for the new website was functionality, ease of use and having users able to book an appointment efficiently. The site needed to emphasize that Janice is more than just a hairstylist, but instead she can cater to an individual's needs and is available off set. Furthermore, our client understands how pricing can be misconceiving at other studios, and that bills can change from person to person. At her studio she charges a flat rate, and wanted it shown on her front page. Other musts were having a blog page and an updated modern interface design that would attract new customers.</p>

        <h2 class="zetta push-0">CMS Implementation</h2>
        <p>To allow customizability of the website for the client, I implemeted <i>Netlify</i>, a content management systems that builds the website with <i>Jekyll.</i>  <i>Netlify</i> allows me as the developer to choose what areas the client will be able to change and update. This allows me to ensure the client can keep their content up to date, without having to worry about breaking their website.</p>
