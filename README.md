Paul Dorsey, Graphic Designer

As a kid, my biggest passions in life were playing hockey and designing. My mom is a florist and my dad was a professional football player, so sports and design have always been in my blood. As a hockey goalie I played in some of the highest leagues in the world. One of the things I enjoyed most about being a goalie was getting to design my own gear. “Look good, feel good, play good,” was a modo I always lived by as i loved designing my gear. Furthermore, Although making the big save in front of thousands of people was exciting on its own, it was the in game entertainment such as on-ice and big screen special effects, that excited me even more. When my hockey playing days came to an end, there was little doubt about the career path I would choose next, I wanted to become a designer in the sporting industry.
